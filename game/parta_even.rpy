    Rival "You sure you want to do that after what happened last time?"
    "Blake winces at the memory. Some of Shay’s friends can be… more abrasive than tactful. Passive aggressive comments, marinara sauce and Blake’s shirt are not a good combination."

    "The bell above the door rings and Blake’s head snaps up, ready to greet the new customer. Her newfound confidence evaporates when she sees who it is. "

    CW_side happy "Sure thing. Anything else? We’ve just put out some new banana bread. It’s made with a different recipe. "

    Customer "Sure, why not."
    CW_side "No worries. That’ll be $7.25 in total."

    MC "Uh okay, that’s new."
    CW_side "All her orders are like this, I swear."
    "Maya scratches her chin in thoughtfulness. She takes the ticket and picks up one of the milk frothing jugs."

    CW_side "I dunno. Student, maybe? It's quiet here. I know I’d work better without the distractions at home. My video games would be crying out to me."
    MC "Maybe, but her clothes look too fancy. She might be working for one of those corporations in those offices close by. "
    CW_side "She looks a bit young, though. Maybe just baby-faced. "
    MC "Maybe she just graduated then."
    CW_side "Do you usually do this? Like... people watch, I mean?"
    MC "It passes time. She is one of the regulars though; she's been coming here every day since we re-opened. "
    "She calls out the name and misses her coworker cocking an eyebrow at her spelling, though Maya doesn't say anything. Marllie leaves her laptop at the table. She looks at her drink, looks at Blake, at Maya, back at Blake, and Blake's never felt so scrutinized in her life even though she lives with Shay, and then seemingly satisfied leaves with her things."

    "It's been a busier morning today, with more than a few exhausted parents and college students."
    "Blake finds herself watching the clock with growing trepidation, because she knows that girl with the impossible order is going to come in at about 10AM and it's already 9:50AM and what the fuck is it going to be today?"
    "Sure enough, she's just refilling the napkin dispenser when Marllie trots into the shop. Blake can feel the sweat dripping down her neck with today's hot weather, yet somehow Marllie is sporting a coat and her hair is still down. Apparently, she isn't feeling the heat on quite the same level."

    "Blake takes a deep breath."
    CW_side happy "Hi! What can I get you today?"
    "Marllie brushes her hair out of her eyes and shifts her computer case into her other hand, eyeing the menu. Blake can almost feel the sweat droplets forming on her forehead."
    Customer "Hm, I’ll have a extra large latte, four shots."
    "Blake exhales, disbelieving. Four shots is a little much, but this order is so simple and straightforward that there has to be a catch."
    CW_side "Of course. Will that be all?"
    Customer "Actually…"
    CW_side sad"{b}{i}No, please. Why did I ask? A normal order for once, please.{/i}{/b}"
    "Marllie actually looks a tiny bit apologetic."
    Customer "Actually, can you put two decaf shots at the bottom, milk, two normal shots on top and minimal foam? Also extra hot milk"
    "Blake fights to keep her expression neutral. She can feel the herculean effort she’s exerting to stop her left eye from twitching."
    CW_side neutral "You betcha. Extra large latte, four shots with milk as hot as it will go without it exploding in my face, coming right up."
    "Marllie smiles, looking relieved. "

    Customer "As long as it’s not too much trouble."
    CW_side happy "…None at all."
    "Marllie watches her as Blake scribbles her name onto the cup, money ready in hand. The rest of the transaction thankfully goes smoothly, and Marllie shoots her another small smile before she turns to head to her favourite table. Blake debates dunking her face in the sink as she begins to fill the order. Maybe the milk will explode in her face and grant her mercy. She can only hope."

    Bestie "What is it today?"
    "Blake merely grunts and tilts her head towards the ticket, eyes not leaving the thermometer so she doesn’t actually get a faceful of boiling milk. Asher peers at the ticket, letting out a snort."

    CW_side sad "GOD, I know! It’s like she enjoys watching my suffering."

    "{b}MARLLIE{/b}"
    "Blake’s eyes widen before she remembers what she had written on the cup. "
    "{b}MARLLY{/b}"
    "She has a dramatic flashback to every other time she’s written Marllie’s name and she’s more than certain none of them were correct. That was fine, but not when there was an actual name printed on the back of a jacket three feet in front of her and she still got it wrong. She leans on the countertop and covers her face with her hands just as Asher walks back out."

    CW_side sad "No, worse."
    Bestie "What do you mean?"
    CW_side "I’ve kind of sort of been spelling her name wrong the entire time that I’ve worked here. So like, I’m going to take my break now so I can throw myself off the bridge."

    CW_side "Wow, thanks for the sympathy. "
    "Asher flashes her a charming smile."
    Bestie "You’re welcome! "
    "He laughs again, lightly patting her on the back."
    Bestie "Really though, I spell names wrong on purpose. Some customers find it funny. Others are just assholes. She hasn’t thrown a fit so I wouldn’t worry about it. "
    "Blake’s voice is muffled in her hands."
    CW_side "Really?"
