    Rival "Why didn’t you bring a jacket? I told you before we left."
    CW_side sad "Thought it was warmer. We’ll be out of the wind soon anyway."
    "Shay tuts disapprovingly."
    Rival "That’s what you said last time and you caught a cold for like, a week. You are atrocious to deal with when you’re sick."
    CW_side neutral "Pot, meet kettle."
    Rival "At least I don’t claim that I’m actually dying."
    CW_side sad "Well I felt like I was."
    Rival "If you get sick again I'm staying at a friend's for the week."
    CW_side happy "That's almost tempting."
    Rival "Rude."
    CW_side happy "Uh huh."

    Rival "I won’t be home for dinner. The girls and I are going to try that fancy new Italian place near the train station. "
    CW_side sad "Aw, where was my invite?"
    "Shay raises an eyebrow at Blake."
    Rival "You sure you want to do that after what happened last time?"
    "Blake winces at the memory. Some of Shay’s friends can be… more abrasive than tactful. Passive aggressive comments, marinara sauce and Blake’s shirt are not a good combination."
    CW_side neutral "Okay, yeah. Maybe next time."
    "They walk in silence before coming to a stop in front of Shay’s workplace."
    CW_side happy "Have a terrible day at work, bitch."

    "Shay flips her off over her shoulder as she walks away."

    "The morning has been going well so far. A little trouble, but Maya has been here to help each time. Blake's even managed to sell most of the banana bread. Jun will be happy."
    "She's actually starting to feel more confident."
    "The bell above the door rings and Blake’s head snaps up, ready to greet the new customer. Her newfound confidence evaporates when she sees who it is. "
    CW_side sad "<panicked image> Oh my God, I forgot to check the clock. Fuck, she’s here again. Please help."

    MC "What are you-"

    "The new customer walks up to the counter. Blake knows exactly who she is and she plasters on a tight smile, internally preparing herself for whatever convoluted order she’s about to receive."
    CW_side happy "Good morning! What can I get for you this morning?"
    show customer
    Customer "Can I please get a quad, non-fat, extra hot caramel macchiato, upside down?"
    CW_side sad "{i}What... the... Fuck?{/i}"
    CW_side "{i}Upside down???? Who is this girl?{/i}"
    "Blake keys the order into the register and repeats it. Marllie nods in confirmation."
    CW_side happy "Sure thing. Anything else? We’ve just put out some new banana bread. It’s made with a different recipe. "
    "Marllie ponders this for a moment. She opens her wallet to take out another bill."
    Customer "Sure, why not."
    CW_side "No worries. That’ll be $7.25 in total."
    "Marllie pays and heads off to her usual table. Blake waits until she’s busy taking out her things before turning to Maya."

    CW_side sad "You gotta help me."
    "Maya finishes rinsing out some equipment and turns to Blake."
    MC "Of course. Something with the order?"
    "Blake holds up the ticket in lieu of an explanation. She watches as Maya’s expression shifts from neutral to confused, both eyebrows furrowing."
    MC "Uh okay, that’s new."
    CW_side "All her orders are like this, I swear."
    "Maya scratches her chin in thoughtfulness. She takes the ticket and picks up one of the milk frothing jugs."
    MC "Good practice, I guess? I think i know what she means. Here, I'll show you."
    CW_side "I wouldn’t object to a few easy ones in the morning though."
    hide mc
    "Luckily, there are no new customers to attend to. It takes two attempts, and both Maya and Blake working together to complete the order properly. The mug of coffee sits on the counter as Blake waits for the bread to come out of the toaster. "
    show mc
    MC "What do you think she does?"
    CW_side neutral "What do you mean?"
    MC "Well, she’s here almost every day and for a couple of hours. Always on her computer. "
    CW_side "I dunno. Student, maybe? It's quiet here. I know I’d work better without the distractions at home. My video games would be crying out to me."
    MC "Maybe, but her clothes look too fancy. She might be working for one of those corporations in those offices close by. "
    CW_side "She looks a bit young, though. Maybe just baby-faced. "
    MC "Maybe she just graduated then."
    CW_side "Do you usually do this? Like... people watch, I mean?"
    MC "It passes time. She is one of the regulars though; she's been coming here every day since we re-opened. "
    "She calls out the name and misses her coworker cocking an eyebrow at her spelling, though Maya doesn't say anything. Marllie leaves her laptop at the table. She looks at her drink, looks at Blake, at Maya, back at Blake, and Blake's never felt so scrutinized in her life even though she lives with Shay, and then seemingly satisfied leaves with her things."
    "Blake lets out a breath she didn't know she was holding."
    MC "See. We got it."
    CW_side happy "Yeah. We did."
    "Maya offers a high five. Blake slaps her hand against her’s gratefully."
