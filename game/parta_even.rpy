    "Blake shivers in the wind."
    CW_side sad "Jesus, what's with the sudden cold snap?"

    Rival "Why didn’t you bring a jacket? I told you before we left."
    CW_side sad "Thought it was warmer. We’ll be out of the wind soon anyway."
    "Shay tuts disapprovingly."
    Rival "That’s what you said last time and you caught a cold for like, a week. You are atrocious to deal with when you’re sick."
    CW_side neutral "Pot, meet kettle."
    Rival "At least I don’t claim that I’m actually dying."
    CW_side sad "Well I felt like I was."
    Rival "If you get sick again I'm staying at a friend's for the week."
    CW_side happy "That's almost tempting."
    Rival "Rude."
    CW_side happy "Uh huh."

    "They stop at a busy road. Shay's workplace is even closer and Blake can just make it out now behind all the passing cars."

    Rival "I won’t be home for dinner. The girls and I are going to try that fancy new Italian place near the train station. "
    CW_side sad "Aw, where was my invite?"
    "Shay raises an eyebrow at Blake."
    Rival "You sure you want to do that after what happened last time?"
    "Blake winces at the memory. Some of Shay’s friends can be… more abrasive than tactful. Passive aggressive comments, marinara sauce and Blake’s shirt are not a good combination."
    CW_side neutral "Okay, yeah. Maybe next time."
    "They walk in silence before coming to a stop in front of Shay’s workplace."
    CW_side happy "Have a terrible day at work, bitch."

    "Shay flips her off over her shoulder as she walks away."
    Rival "You too, ho."
